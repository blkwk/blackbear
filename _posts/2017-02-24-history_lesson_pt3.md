Having a stock height XJ wasn't gonna do it. And these stock wheels with mismatched A/T tires? That look isn't gonna do it either. Thus began the quest to lift the rust bucket.

### Give me all the bacon and eggs you have

I began scouring forums and Craigslist to see what I could find as far as used lifts, since I had no money to spend on it. I managed to find a guy in Illinos that would meet me halfway that was getting rid of (so I thought) some 15" Cragar D-windows with some 33" General Grabbers. I took off to meet him past Greencastle and grab the wheels/tires.

They seemed to look good. The price was right. Once I got them paid for and loaded up, I headed back home. Unfortunately, when I was about 15 miles from home, things started to get dim. By dim, I mean that the instrument cluser and radio was getting dimmer and my headlights were starting to become non-existant. Great. I pushed it a bit further towards the next exit, while things got darker and darker. The highway was sure a fun time for this to happen. Luckily, I managed to push my way to a truck stop and stall out right at the top of an exit, which was on a hill. I got out and managed to push the XJ a bit where it started to roll down a hill into the truck stop. I locked it up and luckily managed to get ahold of a friend that could come at grab me, since it was almost midnight.

While I was waiting, I popped the hood and pulled the battery to take back with me. Figured that I could have it checked to see if that was the culprit. The next day, I managed to get to AutoZone and ran a diagnostic on it (because at this point in my life, I didn't even own a battery tender or charger). Good thing I did, because this thing was DEAD dead. Went ahead and traded it in as core for a new battery and was on my way. Got a ride back to the truck stop, plopped the new battery in and was on my way. That was until the next week when I was out shopping and it happened again. Actually, this time, I just had nothing when I went to start it. No lights, no click, no nothing.

It was too cold out to mess with it, so I left it at the store that night and headed home. Went back the next day, pulled the new battery and took it over to AutoZone for a check again. This time, it had a full charge and everything looked ok. Granted, it was a new battery, so it should have been ok. Went back to the XJ and plopped it back in, tried to crank it over, and nothing...

### I hate the cold

Know what it was? The same thing that I always had problems with the next few years on this thing. A bad ground. Yup. The negative battery terminal evidentally could never be cranked down enough to form a good enough seal on the terminal, so electronics became something that worked when they wanted to. After extensive troubleshooting, I figured this out and finally replaced the cable. The XJ started up every single time and ran like a champ ever since.

Black Bear. She doesn't have a proper name or a build journal yet, so the proper name will have to do for now. The Black Bear is a 2016 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited, in Graphite Crystal Metallic. It's an Auto 3.6L with all of the fun stuff that comes standard on a Black Bear model, along with a remote starter and the 430 radio module.

I'll confess: I'm not really a Jeeper. I haven't grown up with a family that wrenches on anything, let along a CJ5 or even a TJ. I grew up in a Chevy household and didn't perform any substantial modifications to a vehicle until I was out of college. And even then, I had help from people that knew what they were doing, so it was a pretty non-issue if I were to have a problem along the way. At one point, I decided that it was a good idea to start looking for a late model Jeep Cherokee to screw around with.

I managed to locate a 1997 white Cherokee (XJ) on a small car lot on the south side of Indianapolis at the end of one of those delightful early summer weeks. It was priced fairly, compared to some of the newer '00 or '01 models that had fewer miles and less battle scars. I managed to play phone tag with the owner of the small car lot until a Saturday, and he assured me that he would be around for me to take a look at the inside of the XJ and take it for a spin. Well, that was a lie. But, he did call me back and and let my voicemail know that he could meet up with me on Sunday instead.

Now, those of us living in Indiana are used to the archaic Blue Laws of our state. No liquor sales on Sunday. Car dealerships are closed, etc. That didn't matter to the guy at the small car lot though. I met up with him, checked out the XJ and decided that it was a good enough buy and that it should be mine. The owner filled out the paperwork, making sure to hand write me a reciept for my transaction and fill out the transfer paperwork, all dated for the previous Saturday, just in case. "Don't tell the BMV that you bought this on a Sunday" he told me. "I don't want to get shut down for this shit!" So, I guess that I'll keep that info to myself and the owner... the BMV didn't need to know.

### The "build"

She started off as a stock Cherokee. Jeep steel wheels with mismatched tires, basic utility model grille, terrible headlights, sagging suspension, semi-broken tailgate, etc. You name it, this thing had problems with it. After awhile, it looked like this though:

It wasn't an easy journey to get to this point, however.

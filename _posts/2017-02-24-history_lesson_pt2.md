The thing about picking up an older Jeep, even an XJ is that you really need to know or have a willingness to learn how to work on your own vehicle. If you don't, you're in for a bit of a shock when you take it into a shop for some "small" issues.

### (No) Heat?

The first winter with my XJ, I decided that it would be a good idea to take it with us on a road trip up North. That would have been fine if it wasn't cold and I didn't realize that the heater core was almost completely plugged up. I figured this out about halfway up and tried to do a few quick fixes that I read on [NAXJA](http://naxja.org) the first night we were there. There wasn't much of a change in heat output, so we bundled up with blankets on the ride back. Not the best way for a family with a small child to road trip.

When we got back, I took it in to one of the local dealers to have a look. They flushed the core and changed out the thermostat just in case. The called and said that it was done, I rolled in and paid something to the tune of $300 for the repairs. I brushed the accumulated snow off of the windows and hood and headed the few miles back home. Figuring that I'd let the thing warm up a bit before we left so I'd have heat on the way back was the idea. Fast forward to 15 minutes later, when I pull into the driveway and still barely anything out of the vents. _Sigh............_

### Goddammit

I don't remember what the process was that finally fixed me up, but it was something closer to [this](http://www.jeepforum.com/forum/f9/heater-core-flush-diy-w-photos-1266369/). Repeated flushes were the only thing that seemed to help, and finally after doing it a bunch of times, I was breaking things loose. I'm sure that the guys at the Jeep dealership didn't really want to flush the system more than once, if they had better things to do.

Once the heat was fixed up and winter passed, summer would prove to be another fun time, when it started to get hot and I realized that all of the refrigerant from the A/C wasn't staying in the system. While it's fine to not have air 3/4 of the year, there are those hot and steamy days that you really just need to close the windows and crank up the air. So, I went to Advance Auto and picked up a recharge kit and filled up the system.

Having never done this before, I was apprehensive at first. Was this gonna be a giant pain? Was it going to work? Once I found the right place in the system to plug the charge kit in, it was only a matter of watching the meter (yeah, I bought a fancy one with an actual gauge on it) and stopping when it said that it was full, or close to it. It worked! I had cold air again. For about two days.

### Well Then

I limped through the rest of the summer by buying a new can and charging the system when I really needed A/C for a trip. I did plenty of leak tests and could never find where it was leaking out from. Not sure what I did to appease the gods of all that is not having a heat stroke, but one of the last charges that I put in must have sealed up one of the leaks because the system held the charge for almost a month. Which was good, because as a tall/kinda bigger guy, it doesn't take much for me to fat guy sweat through a t-shirt.

Now that the HVAC was all buttoned up (mostly), it was time to do <a href="/general/2017/02/25/history_lesson_pt3.html">some other dumb shit</a>!
